# CodeSamples
Some snippets of my stuff, got some Unity VR, C# and Python.

I show some different Web Frameworks and some stuff related to Socket Networking in Unity. There is also a quick demo of mapping controller buttons to events for HTC Vive.

I also threw in some of my Python ORM for working with MySQL community edition. Shows a 100% RESTful application that utilizes request parsers to process the data and map it to correct DB columns.

Some of the code is experimental (I haven't fully tested, and some I just started working on), so there might be some syntax errors as I've been copying over to GH, and rewriting variable and class names.

Dig through it and let me know how you feel!

Thanks!
Chris
